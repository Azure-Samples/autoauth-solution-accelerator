## Key Pain Points

- **Provider Burden**: Physicians handle ~41 PA requests/week, consuming ~13 hours, leading to administrative fatigue.  
- **Payor Inefficiencies**: Up to 75% of PA tasks remain manual, costing payors ~$3.14 per request.  
- **Patient Impact**: 93% of physicians report PA delays patient care; many patients abandon treatment due to long waiting times.

## Regulatory and Industry Trends

- **Mandates for Transparency**: Emerging standards like CMS rules push for greater data sharing, FHIR-based APIs, and faster turnaround times.
- **Demand for Automation**: Growing interest in AI/ML to reduce manual tasks, cut costs, and improve accuracy.
