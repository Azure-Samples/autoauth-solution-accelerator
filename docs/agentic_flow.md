The AutoAuth solution revolutionizes the Prior Authorization (PA) process by employing **Agentic AI** - intelligent, autonomous agents that can reason, plan, and execute complex multi-step workflows. This document details how agentic AI principles transform traditional PA processing from manual, error-prone workflows into intelligent, adaptive systems.

## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift from simple prompt-response patterns to intelligent agents capable of:
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Making complex decisions without human intervention
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps
- **Adaptive Planning**: Adjusting strategies based on intermediate results
- **Tool Integration**: Dynamically using various tools and services to achieve goals
- **Self-Correction**: Learning from failures and adapting approaches

## Core Agentic AI Components

### 1. **Intelligent Document Processing Agent**

**Purpose**: Autonomously extract, validate, and structure clinical information from unstructured documents.

**Agentic Capabilities**:
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Automatically identifies and categorizes medical entities (diagnoses, medications, lab results)
- **OCR Error Correction**: Self-corrects common OCR mistakes using medical context
- **Data Validation**: Ensures extracted information meets clinical standards
- **Multi-Modal Processing**: Handles various document types (PDFs, images, clinical notes)

**Key Features**:
```python
# Intelligent extraction with field-level validation
clinical_info = await agent.extract_clinical_data(
    documents=image_files,
    validation_schema=ClinicalInformation,
    error_correction=True
)
```

### 2. **Agentic Query Expansion & Formulation**

**Purpose**: Intelligently expand and refine search queries to maximize policy retrieval accuracy.

**Agentic Capabilities**:
- **Semantic Understanding**: Understands medical terminology and relationships
- **Synonym Generation**: Automatically includes medical synonyms and alternative terms
- **Context-Aware Expansion**: Considers diagnosis, medication, and procedure contexts
- **Precision-Recall Optimization**: Balances comprehensive coverage with relevance

**Example Process**:
```jinja
# From the prompt templates
"Prior authorization policy for {{ medication }} for {{ diagnosis }}.
Related terms: {{ synonyms }}, {{ alternative_names }},
dosage requirements, contraindications, prior therapy requirements."
```

### 3. **Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent**

**Purpose**: Intelligently search and retrieve the most relevant PA policies using multiple search strategies.

**Agentic Capabilities**:
- **Hybrid Search Strategy**: Combines vector semantic search with BM25 lexical search
- **Query Classification**: Determines optimal search strategy (semantic vs. keyword)
- **Relevance Evaluation**: Assesses retrieved policies for relevance and completeness
- **Adaptive Retrieval**: Refines search strategy based on initial results

**Search Flow**:
```python
class AgenticRAG:
    async def retrieve_policies(self, clinical_info):
        # 1. Query expansion with medical context
        expanded_query = await self.expand_query(clinical_info)

        # 2. Hybrid search execution
        policies = await self.hybrid_search(expanded_query)

        # 3. Relevance evaluation
        if not self.evaluate_relevance(policies):
            # 4. Adaptive refinement
            return await self.refine_and_retry(clinical_info)

        return policies
```

### 4. **Policy Evaluation & Reasoning Agent**

**Purpose**: Apply complex medical reasoning to evaluate PA requests against policy criteria.

**Agentic Capabilities**:
- **Multi-Criteria Analysis**: Evaluates multiple policy requirements simultaneously
- **Evidence-Based Reasoning**: Links clinical evidence to specific policy criteria
- **Uncertainty Handling**: Identifies gaps and requests additional information when needed
- **Compliance Assessment**: Ensures decisions align with regulatory requirements

**Decision Framework**:
```python
# Multi-step reasoning process
decision_process = [
    "Extract all policy criteria",
    "Map clinical information to criteria",
    "Assess compliance for each criterion",
    "Identify gaps or missing information",
    "Generate evidence-based decision",
    "Provide detailed rationale"
]
```

### 5. **Autonomous Decision Generation Agent**

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive, auditable decisions with detailed reasoning.

**Agentic Capabilities**:
- **Structured Decision Making**: Follows standardized evaluation frameworks
- **Rationale Generation**: Provides clear explanations for each decision
- **Policy Citation**: References specific policy sections supporting decisions
- **Transparency**: Ensures decisions are auditable and explainable

## Agentic AI Skills & Plugin Architecture

### Skills Manager
The AutoAuth system uses a modular skills architecture where AI agents can dynamically load and use specialized capabilities:

```python
# Available agentic skills
skills = [
    "retrieval",      # Policy search and retrieval
    "evaluation",     # Clinical assessment and validation
    "rewriting",      # Query refinement and optimization
    "main"           # Core workflow orchestration
]
```

### Dynamic Function Calling
Agents can dynamically invoke tools and services based on context:
