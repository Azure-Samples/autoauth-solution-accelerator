However, efficacy has not been established in patients with ulcerative colitis who have lost response or were intolerant to another TNFi.\n\n· Uveitis, in patients ≥ 2 years of age with noninfectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis.\n\n\n## Guidelines\n\nTNFis are featured prominently in guidelines for treatment of inflammatory conditions.\n\n. Ankylosing Spondylitis and Spondyloarthritis: Guidelines for ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondylitis are published by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/Spondylitis Association of America/Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (2019).3 TNFis are recommended as the initial biologic. In those who are secondary non-responders to a TNFi, a second TNFi is recommended over switching out of the class.\n\n· Crohn\'s Disease: The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) has guidelines for Crohn\'s disease (2018).4 TNFis are listed as an option for disease that is resistant to corticosteroids, severely active disease, perianal fistulizing disease, and maintenance of remission. In post-operative Crohn\'s disease, a TNFi should be started within 4 weeks of surgery to prevent recurrence. Guidelines from the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) [2021] include TNFis among the therapies for moderate to severe Crohn\'s disease, for induction and maintenance of remission.17\n\n• Hidradenitis Suppurativa: British guidelines (2018) recommend consideration of adalimumab for those with moderate to severe disease who do not respond to conventional therapy.19\n\n· JIA: There are guidelines from ACR and the Arthritis Foundation for the treatment of JIA (2021) which address oligoarthritis and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis. For oligoarthritis, a biologic is recommended following a trial of a\n\n3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions - Adalimumab Products Prior Authorization Policy\n\nconventional synthetic DMARD.6 In patients with TMJ arthritis, scheduled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or intra-articular glucocorticoids are recommended first-line. A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic ± conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage).\n\nPlaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7\n\n· PSA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-naïve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8\n\n· Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2\n\n• Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio® (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz®/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole, ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g., infliximab).\n\n. Uveitis and Ocular Inflammatory Disorders: American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) guidelines (2014) note that adalimumab may be used in patients with uveitis due to various causes (e.g., spondyloarthropathy-associated or human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-B27-associated uveitis, JIA-associated uveitis, and other posterior uveitides and panuveitis syndromes). 12 Adalimumab should be considered second-line in vision-threatening JIA-associated uveitis when methotrexate has failed or is not tolerated (strong recommendation) and may be used as corticosteroid-sparing treatment for vision-threatening chronic uveitis from seronegative spondyloarthropathy (strong recommendation). Adalimumab may also be considered in other patients who have vision-threatening or corticosteroid- dependent disease who have failed first-line therapies. Adalimumab should be considered as a second-line immunomodulatory agent for severe ocular inflammatory conditions including chronic and severe scleritis. ACR/Arthritis Federation guidelines (2019) for uveitis associated with JIA make recommendations for use of conventional systemic DMARDs and biologics. In patients with severe active chronic anterior uveitis associated with sight-threatening complications, a TNFi (monoclonal antibody) + methotrexate is recommended.19\n\n<!-- PageFooter="3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions - Adalimumab Products Prior Authorization Policy" -->\n\n## Other Uses with Supportive Evidence\n\nThere are guidelines and/or published data supporting the use of adalimumab products in the following conditions:\n\n. Behcet\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet\'s disease. 12\n\n· Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective.\n\n· Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15\n\n\n## POLICY STATEMENT\n\nPrior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab products. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with adalimumab products as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval requires the agent to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.\n\n· Abrilada™ (adalimumab-afzb subcutaneous injection - Pfizer)\n\n. adalimumab-aacf subcutaneous injection (Fresenius Kabi)\n\n· adalimumab-adaz subcutaneous injection (Sandoz/Novartis)\n\n. adalimumab-adbm subcutaneous injection (Boehringer Ingelheim)\n\n· adalimumab-fkjp subcutaneous injection (Mylan)\n\n· adalimumab-ryvk subcutaneous injection (Teva/Alvotech)\n\n· Amjevita (adalimumab-atto subcutaneous injection - Amgen)\n\n.

Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.\n\nNote: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g., methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination with this medication.\n\n2\\. Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR). EULAR/ACR guidelines for the management of PMR (2015) strongly recommend against the use of TNFis for treatment of PMR.17 This recommendation is based on lack of evidence for benefit as well as considerable potential for harm.\n\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n1\\.
