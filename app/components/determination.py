## Decision: Needs More Information

### Explanation:
While the provided clinical information indicates that the patient, Sarah Sample, has a diagnosis of Crohn's Disease (ICD-10: K50.90) and presents with severe symptoms that could benefit from Adalimumab therapy, the policy criteria for prior authorization under Cigna's guidelines require additional specific details:

1. **Detailed History of Alternative Treatments and Their Results**:
   - The policy stipulates that for initial therapy approval, the patient must have tried or be currently taking corticosteroids, or corticosteroids must be contraindicated. Alternatively, the patient must have tried one other conventional systemic therapy for Crohn's disease or have specific types of fistulas or have had ileocolonic resection.
   - The provided clinical information does not detail the patient's history of corticosteroid use or other conventional systemic therapies (e.g., azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate).

2. **Prescribing Physician**:
   - The policy requires that the medication be prescribed by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist. This information is not explicitly provided in the clinical details.

### Required Information:
1. **History of Treatments**:
   - Documentation of the patient's use of corticosteroids or other conventional systemic therapies for Crohn's disease and the results of these treatments.
   - If applicable, documentation of contraindications to corticosteroids.
