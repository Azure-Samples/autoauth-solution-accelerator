## üåç Overview

Prior Authorization (PA) is a critical step in healthcare delivery, requiring providers to seek approval from payors before offering certain treatments. While essential for cost control and care management, the current PA process is often manual, fragmented, and time-consuming:

- **Provider Burden**: Physicians handle an average of **41 PA requests per week**, consuming **13 hours**‚Äîalmost two full working days‚Äîleading to high administrative burdens (88% of physicians report it as high or extremely high). [\[1\]](https://www.ama-assn.org/)
- **Payor Costs**: Up to 75% of PA tasks are manual, costing around **$3.14 per request**, and can be reduced by up to 40% through AI-driven automation. [\[2\]](https://sagilityhealth.com/) [\[3\]](https://www.mckinsey.com/)
- **Patient Outcomes**: **93% of physicians** state PA delays necessary care, and **82% of patients** sometimes abandon treatments due to these delays. Even a one-week delay in critical treatments like cancer can increase mortality risk by 1.2‚Äì3.2%. [\[1\]](https://www.ama-assn.org/) [\[3\]](https://www.mckinsey.com/)

This repository aims to **streamline and automate** the PA process using Azure AI, Agentic workflows, and advanced reasoning models. By leveraging machine learning, OCR, and agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we can reduce human labor, cut costs, and ultimately improve patient care.

**Note:** Our methodology, developed in collaboration with a clinicals experts (MD and PharmD), is research-based and includes comprehensive case studie. For an in-depth understanding, please refer to our article on Hashnode. [article on Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/draft/67634f1f4a00b0daf47a772f).

## ü§ñ Introducing AutoAuth

**AutoAuth** revolutionizes the Prior Authorization process through:

- **Intelligent Document Analysis**: OCR and LLM-driven extraction of clinical details from various document types.
- **Smart Policy Matching**: Agentic Rag laveraging Hybrid retrieval systems (Vector + BM25) identify relevant policies and criteria swiftly.
- **Advanced Reasoning Models**: Assess compliance against policies, recommend Approve/Deny decisions, or request additional info with full traceability.

You can seamlessly integrate Prior Authorization (PA) processing into your application using our SDK. The SDK allows you to run PA workflows programmatically, enabling you to automate the end-to-end process.

#### Example Usage

```python
from src.pipeline.paprocessing.run import PAProcessingPipeline

# Instantiate the PA processing pipeline
pa_pipeline = PAProcessingPipeline(send_cloud_logs=True)

# Run the pipeline with uploaded files
await pa_pipeline.run(uploaded_files=files, use_o1=True)
```

##### ‚öôÔ∏è Build & Expand the SDK

Our SDK is designed to be modular, easily extendable, and customizable. Built with FastAPI for seamless API integration, you can quickly expose endpoints and integrate them into your system. This approach ensures fast, secure, and scalable API deployments.
