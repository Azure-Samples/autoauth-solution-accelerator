  "Patient Information": {
    "Patient Name": "Value here", // if not available, mention "Not provided"
    "Patient Date of Birth": "Value here", // if not available, mention "Not provided"
    "Patient ID": "Value here", // if not available, mention "Not provided"
    "Patient Address": "Value here", // if not available, mention "Not provided"
    "Patient Phone Number": "Value here" // if not available, mention "Not provided"
  },
  "Physician Information": {
    "Physician Name": "Value here", // if not available, mention "Not provided"
    "Specialty": "Value here", // if not available, mention "Not provided"
    "Physician Contact": {
      "Office Phone": "Value here", // if not available, mention "Not provided"
      "Fax": "Value here", // if not available, mention "Not provided"
      "Office Address": "Value here" // if not available, mention "Not provided"
    }
  },
  "Clinical Information": {
    "Diagnosis and medical justification (including ICD-10 code)": "Value here", // if not available, mention "Not provided"
    "Detailed history of alternative treatments and results": "Value here", // if not available, mention "Not provided"
    "Relevant lab results or diagnostic imaging": "Value here", // if not available, mention "Not provided"
    "Documented symptom severity and impact on daily life": "Value here", // if not available, mention "Not provided"
    "Prognosis and risk if treatment is not approved": "Value here", // if not available, mention "Not provided"
    "Clinical rationale for urgency (if applicable)": "Value here" // if not available, mention "Not provided"
    "Plan for Treatment or Request for Prior Authorization": {
      "Medication or Procedure": "Value here", // if not available, mention "Not provided"
      "Code": "Value here", // if not available, mention "Not provided"
      "Dosage": "Value here", // if not available, mention "Not provided"
      "Duration": "Value here", // if not available, mention "Not provided"
      "Rationale": "Value here" // if not available, mention "Not provided"
      }
  }
}

4. **Clarity and Professionalism**:
    - Use clear and concise language appropriate for medical documentation.
    - Maintain professional tone and terminology.

5. **Multiple Entries Handling**:
    - If multiple diagnoses, treatments, or lab results are present, list each entry separated by semicolons within the same field.

6. **ICD-10 Codes**:
    - Ensure that any ICD-10 codes are accurately extracted and correspond correctly to the diagnosis.
    - If the ICD-10 code is missing but the diagnosis is present, you may look up the standard ICD-10 code that matches the diagnosis, if appropriate.

7. **Lab Results and Imaging**:
    - Include key findings, values, and any notable abnormalities.
    - Mention the type of test and the date if available.

8. **Symptom Severity and Impact**:
    - Provide details on how the symptoms affect the patient's daily life, including any limitations or impairments.

9. **Prognosis and Risks**:
    - Clearly state the potential outcomes and risks if the treatment is not approved, as documented in the text.

10. **Clinical Rationale for Urgency**:
    - If applicable, explain why the treatment is urgent based on the clinical information provided.

11. **Plan for Treatment or Request for Prior Authorization**:
    - Clearly state the name of the medication or procedure being requested for the patient.
    - Include the code of the medication or procedure if available.
    - State the dosage or plan for the medication or procedure.
    - Specify the duration of doses or days of treatment.
    - Provide the rationale for the medication or procedure based on the clinical information provided.

**Note**: This task involves critical clinical information extraction. Take your time to ensure all details are correctly interpreted and accurately transcribed from the OCR.
