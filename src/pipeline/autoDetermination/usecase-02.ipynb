    "**Clinical Authorization Determinations using a MedHelm Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we demonstrate an evaluator pipeline that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Establishes a Clinical Context:**  \n",
    "   We apply a clinical approach via the MedHelm framework. This approach helps us to evaluate both prior authorization determinations and the clinical rationale behind them by systematically assessing patient, physician, and clinical information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generates an LLM Response:**  \n",
    "   We use the `AutoDeterminationEvaluator`’s `generate_responses` method to obtain a determination from an LLM based on the provided context.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handles Incomplete Context (Failure Scenario):**  \n",
    "   We simulate a case where critical details (e.g., clinical or physical information) are omitted and the evaluator returns an unsatisfactory or failed determination.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Uses an IaC Framework:**  \n",
    "   Instead of ad hoc scripting, our configuration (e.g. test cases defined in YAML) is managed as code, allowing us to spin up or update the evaluation environment dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Enforces Benchmarks with PyTest:**  \n",
    "   We include tests (using PyTest) to guarantee that each evaluation case meets specified metric thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Evaluator Discussion:**  \n",
    "   Our evaluator setup leverages components such as the **FuzzyEvaluator** (which computes semantic similarity, e.g. using fuzzy matching techniques) and the **FactualCorrectnessEvaluator** (which checks the factual integrity of the clinical rationale).\n",
    "\n",
    "_Below, we demonstrate each phase of the pipeline with code examples and commentary._\n",

    "## 1. Clinical Context & the MedHelm Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The MedHelm approach emphasizes a thorough review of clinical, physician, and policy contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Patient Information:** Name, DOB, address, etc.\n",
    "- **Physician Information:** Specialty and contact details.\n",
    "- **Clinical Information:** Diagnosis details, lab results, treatment history, and clinical reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our evaluator pipeline, we load these details from YAML test cases and use them to generate LLM responses. This approach helps ensure that any prior authorization determination (or its clinical rationale) is based on rich, structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now move to the evaluator pipeline code that uses these contexts."

Rheumatoid arthritis, + methotrexate or other conventional synthetic DMARDS to\\nreduce the signs and symptoms, induce major clinical response, inhibit the\\nprogression of structural damage, and improve physical function in adults with\\nmoderately to severely active disease.\\n\\n· Ulcerative colitis, for treatment of moderately to severely active disease in patients\\n≥ 5 years of age. However, efficacy has not been established in patients with\\nulcerative colitis who have lost response or were intolerant to another TNFi.\\n\\n· Uveitis, in patients ≥ 2 years of age with noninfectious intermediate, posterior, and\\npanuveitis.\\n\\n\\n### Guidelines\\n\\nTNFis are featured prominently in guidelines for treatment of inflammatory conditions.\\n\\n· Ankylosing Spondylitis and Spondyloarthritis: Guidelines for ankylosing\\nspondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondylitis are published by the American\\nCollege of Rheumatology (ACR)/Spondylitis Association of America/Spondyloarthritis\\nResearch and Treatment Network (2019).3 TNFis are recommended as the initial\\nbiologic. In those who are secondary non-responders to a TNFi, a second TNFi is\\nrecommended over switching out of the class.\\n\\n· Crohn\\'s Disease: The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) has guidelines\\nfor Crohn\\'s disease (2018).4 TNFis are listed as an option for disease that is resistant\\nto corticosteroids, severely active disease, perianal fistulizing disease, and\\nmaintenance of remission. In post-operative Crohn\\'s disease, a TNFi should be\\nstarted within 4 weeks of surgery to prevent recurrence. Guidelines from the\\nAmerican Gastroenterological Association (AGA) [2021] include TNFis among the\\ntherapies for moderate to severe Crohn\\'s disease, for induction and maintenance of\\nremission. 17\\n\\n· Hidradenitis Suppurativa: British guidelines (2018) recommend consideration of\\nadalimumab for those with moderate to severe disease who do not respond to\\nconventional therapy.19\\n\\n· JIA: There are guidelines from ACR and the Arthritis Foundation for the treatment\\nof JIA (2021) which address oligoarthritis and temporomandibular joint (TMJ)\\narthritis. For oligoarthritis, a biologic is recommended following a trial of a\\n\\n3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions - Adalimumab Products Prior\\nAuthorization Policy\\n\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\nconventional synthetic DMARD.6 In patients with TMJ arthritis, scheduled\\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or intra-articular glucocorticoids\\nare recommended first-line. A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an\\ninadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic ±\\nconventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given\\nthe impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a\\npreferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also\\navailable specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and\\nenthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and\\nenthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g., following\\nDMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis\\nor enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may\\nbe preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g., if there is involvement of high-\\nrisk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or\\nthose judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage).\\n\\n· Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and\\nNational Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy\\ntreatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7\\n\\n· PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in\\ntreatment-naïve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an\\noral therapy.8\\n\\n· Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a\\nbiologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated\\ndose of methotrexate who is not at target.2\\n\\n. Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that\\nthe following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely\\nactive disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic\\ncorticosteroids, Entyvio® (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz®/XR (tofacitinib\\ntablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020)\\nrecommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi.10 In addition to the\\napproved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009)\\nindicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole,\\nciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or\\ntopical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., mesalamine), or\\nimmunosuppressive agents (e.g., infliximab).\\n\\n. Uveitis and Ocular Inflammatory Disorders: American Academy of\\nOphthalmology (AAO) guidelines (2014) note that adalimumab may be used in\\npatients with uveitis due to various causes (e.g., spondyloarthropathy-associated or\\nhuman leukocyte antigen [HLA]-B27-associated uveitis, JIA-associated uveitis, and\\nother posterior uveitides and panuveitis syndromes).12 Adalimumab should be\\nconsidered second-line in vision-threatening JIA-associated uveitis when\\nmethotrexate has failed or is not tolerated (strong recommendation) and may be\\nused as corticosteroid-sparing treatment for vision-threatening chronic uveitis from\\nseronegative spondyloarthropathy (strong recommendation). Adalimumab may also\\nbe considered in other patients who have vision-threatening or corticosteroid-\\ndependent disease who have failed first-line therapies. Adalimumab should be\\nconsidered as a second-line immunomodulatory agent for severe ocular inflammatory\\nconditions including chronic and severe scleritis. ACR/Arthritis Federation guidelines\\n(2019) for uveitis associated with JIA make recommendations for use of conventional\\nsystemic DMARDs and biologics. In patients with severe active chronic anterior\\nuveitis associated with sight-threatening complications, a TNFi (monoclonal antibody)\\n\\\\+ methotrexate is recommended.19\\n\\n<!-- PageFooter=\"3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions - Adalimumab Products Prior Authorization Policy\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n\\n## Other Uses with Supportive Evidence\\n\\nThere are guidelines and/or published data supporting the use of adalimumab products in\\nthe following conditions:\\n\\n. Behcet\\'s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR)\\nrecommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening\\nuveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g., corticosteroids), TNFis\\nare among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous\\nthrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint\\ninvolvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory\\ndisorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with\\nophthalmic manifestations of Behcet\\'s disease and for acute exacerbations of\\npreexisting Behcet\\'s disease. 12\\n\\n· Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical\\nand systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone\\nis the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic\\ntherapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide,\\nmycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab\\nproducts). In case reports, TNFis have been effective.\\n\\n· Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis\\n(2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and\\nimmunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15\\n\\n\\n## POLICY STATEMENT\\n\\nPrior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab\\nproducts.
