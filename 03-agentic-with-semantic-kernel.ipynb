    "Before diving into the implementation, let's understand the key components of Semantic Kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kernel is the central orchestrator in Semantic Kernel. It manages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Connecting to AI Models**: Interfaces with various AI models via connectors.\n",
    "- **Registering and Invoking Plugins**: Manages the lifecycle and execution of plugins.\n",
    "- **Managing Memory and Context**: Maintains state and context across interactions.\n",
    "- **Interacting with the Planner**: Coordinates with the Planner to achieve specified goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Connectors allow the Kernel to interface with various AI models and services. They define how the Kernel communicates with these models, whether they're:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenAI Models**: Such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4.\n",
    "- **Azure OpenAI Services**: Leveraging Microsoft's cloud-based AI capabilities.\n",
    "- **Local Models**: Using libraries like Hugging Face Transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugins are modular units that extend the Kernel's functionality. They consist of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt Functions**: Use natural language prompts to interact with AI models.\n",
    "- **Native Functions**: Written in Python, performing deterministic tasks or interfacing with external services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugins act as building blocks for complex workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Planner\n",
    "\n",
    "The Planner uses AI to dynamically create a sequence of actions (a plan) to achieve a specified goal. It considers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Available Plugins and Their Functions**: Understands the capabilities of each plugin.\n",
    "- **Function Descriptions**: Uses metadata to understand what each function does.\n",
    "- **Combining Functions**: Determines how functions can be combined to fulfill the goal.\n"

    "### ðŸŒŸ Creating a Multi-Agent Architecture for Medical Research Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of medical research, producing high-quality documentation is crucial. This guide aims to design a multi-agent system consisting of three specialized agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Medical Researcher**: Gathers and summarizes relevant medical information.\n",
    "- **Clinical Evaluator**: Assesses the clinical relevance and accuracy of the information.\n",
    "- **Medical Editor**: Refines the language and ensures adherence to medical writing standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Semantic Kernel's capabilities, we'll create plugins representing these agents and use a Planner to dynamically orchestrate their workflow based on a given goal.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Plugins**: Create plugins for the Medical Researcher, Clinical Evaluator, and Medical Editor.\n",
    "2. **Configure the Kernel**: Set up the Kernel with the necessary connectors and plugins.\n",
    "3. **Develop the Planner**: Implement the Planner to dynamically orchestrate the workflow.\n",
    "4. **Execute the Plan**: Run the system to produce high-quality medical documentation."
