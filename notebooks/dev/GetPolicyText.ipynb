      "an otherwise healthy infant. Affected individuals can develop many seizure types:\n",

      "several different types of seizures, most commonly atonic seizures (sudden loss of\n",
      "muscle tone and limpness) and tonic seizures.6,9 The three main forms of treatment\n",
      "of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are ASMs, dietary therapy (typically the ketogenic diet),\n",
      "and device/surgery (e.g., vagus nerve stimulation, corpus callostomy).9 None of the\n",

      "\n",
      "In 2014, an expanded access program was initiated to provide Epidiolex to patients\n",
      "with treatment-resistant epilepsy.14 Of the 840 patients included in a published\n",
      "review, 192 patients were diagnosed with Dravet syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut\n",
      "syndrome, and 648 patients were diagnosed with other conditions, including CDKL5\n",
      "deficiency disorder, Dup15q, Aicardi, and Doose syndromes; febrile infection-related\n",
      "epilepsy syndromes; tuberous sclerosis complex; Sturge-Weber syndrome;\n",
      "lissencephaly; cortical malformation/dysplasia; and myoclonic absence. The patients\n",
      "enrolled in the study had severe, intractable, childhood-onset treatment-resistant\n",
      "epilepsy and were on stable doses of ASMs for 4 weeks before starting Epidiolex as\n",
      "add-on therapy. The initial dose of Epidiolex was 2 to 10 mg/kg/day (taken as two\n",
      "divided doses) and gradually titrated until intolerance or to a maximum dose of 25\n",
      "mg/kg/day or 50 mg/kg/day, depending upon treatment site. Of those enrolled in\n",
      "the expanded access program, 892 patients were evaluated and included in the safety\n",
      "analysis set and 840 patients were included in the efficacy analysis set. Through 192\n",
      "weeks, the median percentage reduction in seizure frequency across visit windows\n",
      "ranged from 50% to 67% for convulsive seizures and 46% to 66% for total seizures.\n",
      "In a cohort of 132 patients (72 children, 60 adults) with treatment-resistant epilepsy,\n",
      "bi-weekly seizure frequency decreased from a mean of 144.4 at entry to 52.2 at 12\n",
      "weeks (P = 0.01) and remained stable thereafter.15 Of note, patients with a diagnosis\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Dravet Syndrome\n",
      "\n",
      "At this time, there are three drugs approved for the treatment of seizures associated\n",
      "with Dravet syndrome: Epidiolex, Diacomit® (stiripentol capsules, powder for oral\n",
      "suspension), and Fintepla® (fenfluramine oral solution).1,11,17 An expert panel\n",
      "considers valproic acid and clobazam to be the first-line treatment for Dravet\n",
      "syndrome.4 If seizure control is suboptimal, Diacomit and topiramate are second-\n",
      "line treatment. Ketogenic diet is moderately effective and can also be considered\n",
      "second-line. The Dravet Foundation states that Diacomit, Epidiolex, and Fintepla are\n",
      "considered first-line agents for the treatment of Dravet syndrome.2 If control is still\n",
      "inadequate, other therapies to consider are clonazepam, levetiracetam, and\n",
      "zonisamide.2,4 Sodium channel blockers (e.g., carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine,\n",
      "lamotrigine, and phenytoin) can worsen seizures in Dravet syndrome. Additionally,\n",
      "vigabatrin and tiagabine may increase the frequency of myoclonic seizures and should\n",
      "be avoided.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, the FDA-approved drugs for this condition are Epidiolex, Fintepla,\n",
      "felbamate, Banzel® (rufinamide tablet, oral suspension), lamotrigine, topiramate, and\n",
      "clobazam.12 Despite the lack of level I or level II evidence, valproic acid remains a\n",
      "mainstay in treatment.8,9,13 If valproic acid does not provide adequate seizure\n",
      "control, which is almost always the case, lamotrigine should be added as the first\n",
      "adjunctive therapy.7 If the combination regimen of valproic acid and lamotrigine does\n",
      "not provide adequate control, then Banzel should be initiated and either valproic acid\n",
      "or lamotrigine should be discontinued. If seizure control is still not achieved, the\n",
      "next adjunctive therapies to consider are topiramate, clobazam, and felbamate.\n",
      "There is limited evidence for the use of levetiracetam, zonisamide, and Fycompa®\n",
      "(perampanel tablet, oral suspension). Where possible, no more than two ASMs should\n",
      "be used concomitantly; use of multiple ASMs raise the risk of side effects and/or\n",
