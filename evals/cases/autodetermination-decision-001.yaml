        Prior Auth AI Determination

        Approved

        Rationale

        Based on the provided patient information and the policy criteria for the use of Adalimumab in Crohn's Disease, the request meets all the necessary requirements for approval. The patient is 9 years old, has tried corticosteroid therapy without improvement, and the medication is prescribed by a pediatric gastroenterologist. Therefore, the request should be approved.

        Summary of Findings

        The patient is a 9-year-old girl diagnosed with Crohn's Disease.
        She has tried corticosteroid therapy (Methylprednisolone) without improvement in symptoms.
        The medication is prescribed by a pediatric gastroenterologist.
        All policy criteria for initial therapy with Adalimumab for Crohn's Disease are fully met.
        Detailed Analysis

        Policy Reference: Policy under "2. Crohn's Disease", A) Initial Therapy, criterion i.
        Criterion ii: Patient meets ONE of the following (a, b, c, or d):

        a) Patient has tried or is currently taking corticosteroids, or corticosteroids are contraindicated in this patient.
        Assessment: Fully Met

        Missing Information

        Information Needed: None.
        Reason: All required information has been provided and all policy criteria are fully met.
      context:
        policy_text: "Content from https://storagepriorauth72frx66.blob.core.windows.net/pre-auth-policies/policies_ocr/001.pdf was approved because it explicitly addressed the use of Adalimumab (Humira) for Crohn's Disease, mentioning prior authorization criteria and guidelines for TNFi usage in cases of severe Crohn's symptoms. It also referenced the American College of Gastroenterology guidelines, which are pertinent to the user's query regarding biologic therapy initiation."
