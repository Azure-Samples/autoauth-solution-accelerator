        The prior authorization request for Afinitor (everolimus) in combination with Nexavar (sorafenib) is Approved because the patient, Aiden Smith, meets all the policy criteria outlined under section O. Bone Cancer - Osteosarcoma. Specifically, he has a diagnosis of metastatic osteosarcoma, has relapsed after first-line therapy, is receiving second-line therapy, and the treatment involves Afinitor used in combination with Nexavar.

          ## 1. Background:

          Afinitor (everolimus) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women
          with advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer in combination with
          Aromasin® (exemestane) after failure of treatment with Femara® (letrozole) or Arimidex®
          (anastrozole); in adults with progressive neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin (PNET) and
          adults with progressive, well-differentiated, non-functional neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of
          gastrointestinal (GI) or lung origin that are unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic; adults
          with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of treatment with Sutent® (sunitinib) or
          Nexavar® (sorafenib); adults with renal angiomyolipoma and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC),
          not requiring immediate surgery; treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 1 year and older
          with TSC who have subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) that requires therapeutic
          intervention but cannot be curatively resected; and for the adjunctive treatment of adult and
          pediatric patients aged 2 years and older with TSC-associated partial-onset seizures.1

          Afinitor is not indicated for the treatment of patients with functional carcinoid tumors.

          The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) also recommends use of Afinitor in
          invasive and inflammatory breast cancer, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia /
          lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, neuroendocrine tumors, kidney cancer, soft tissue sarcomas,
          osteosarcomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, thymomas and thymic carcinomas, Hodgkin
          lymphoma, follicular, oncocytic, and papillary thyroid carcinomas, subependymal giant cell
          astrocytoma (SEGA), meningioma, histiocytic neoplasms, and endometrial carcinoma.2


          ## Coverage Information:

          Members will be required to meet the criteria below for coverage. For members under the age of
          19 years, the prescription will automatically process without a coverage review.

          Where such mandates apply, they supersede language in the benefit document or in the
          notification criteria.

          ## 1. Background:

          Afinitor (everolimus) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women
          with advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer in combination with
          Aromasin® (exemestane) after failure of treatment with Femara® (letrozole) or Arimidex®
          (anastrozole); in adults with progressive neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin (PNET) and
          adults with progressive, well-differentiated, non-functional neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of
          gastrointestinal (GI) or lung origin that are unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic; adults
          with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of treatment with Sutent® (sunitinib) or
          Nexavar® (sorafenib); adults with renal angiomyolipoma and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC),
          not requiring immediate surgery; treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 1 year and older
          with TSC who have subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) that requires therapeutic
          intervention but cannot be curatively resected; and for the adjunctive treatment of adult and
          pediatric patients aged 2 years and older with TSC-associated partial-onset seizures.1

          Afinitor is not indicated for the treatment of patients with functional carcinoid tumors.

          The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) also recommends use of Afinitor in
          invasive and inflammatory breast cancer, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia /
          lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, neuroendocrine tumors, kidney cancer, soft tissue sarcomas,
          osteosarcomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, thymomas and thymic carcinomas, Hodgkin
          lymphoma, follicular, oncocytic, and papillary thyroid carcinomas, subependymal giant cell
          astrocytoma (SEGA), meningioma, histiocytic neoplasms, and endometrial carcinoma.2


          ## Coverage Information:

          Members will be required to meet the criteria below for coverage. For members under the age of
          19 years, the prescription will automatically process without a coverage review.

          Some states mandate benefit coverage for off-label use of medications for some diagnoses or
          under some circumstances. Some states also mandate usage of other Compendium references.
          Where such mandates apply, they supersede language in the benefit document or in the
          notification criteria.
