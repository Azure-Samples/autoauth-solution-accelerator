          ## OVERVIEW

          Epidiolex, a cannabinoid, is indicated in patients ≥ 1 year of age for the treatment
          of seizures associated with:1

          · Dravet syndrome.

          . Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

          · Tuberous sclerosis complex.


          ## Disease Overview

          Dravet syndrome is a rare genetic epileptic encephalopathy marked with frequent
          and/or prolonged seizures.2,3 The seizures generally begin in the first year of life in
          an otherwise healthy infant. Affected individuals can develop many seizure types:
          myoclonic, tonic-clonic, absence, atypical absence, atonic, focal aware or impaired
          awareness (previously called partial seizures), and status epilepticus.3 Two or more
          antiseizure medications (ASMs) are often needed to control the seizures; most of the
          seizures are refractory to medications. The goals of treatment are cessation of
          prolonged convulsions, reduction in overall seizure frequency, and minimization of
          treatment side effects. 4,5

          Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe epileptic and developmental encephalopathy, is
          associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality.6,7 Lennox-Gastaut syndrome

          Policy

          <!-- PageBreak -->

          most often begins between 3 and 5 years of age.6-9 Affected children experience
          several different types of seizures, most commonly atonic seizures (sudden loss of
          muscle tone and limpness) and tonic seizures.6,9 The three main forms of treatment
          of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are ASMs, dietary therapy (typically the ketogenic diet),
          and device/surgery (e.g., vagus nerve stimulation, corpus callostomy).9 None of the
          therapies are effective in all cases of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and the disorder has
          proven particularly resistant to most therapeutic options.

          Tuberous sclerosis complex is a rare, genetic disease that causes non-cancerous
          (benign) tumors to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys,
          heart, eyes, lungs, and skin.1º It can result in a combination of symptoms including
          seizures, impaired intellectual development, autism, behavioral problems, skin
          abnormalities, and kidney disease. Seizures affect most individuals with tuberous
          sclerosis complex at some point during their life and can be difficult to control.


          ## Clinical Efficacy in Other Refractory Seizures

          In 2014, an expanded access program was initiated to provide Epidiolex to patients
          with treatment-resistant epilepsy.14 Of the 840 patients included in a published
          review, 192 patients were diagnosed with Dravet syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut
          syndrome, and 648 patients were diagnosed with other conditions, including CDKL5
          deficiency disorder, Dup15q, Aicardi, and Doose syndromes; febrile infection-related
          epilepsy syndromes; tuberous sclerosis complex; Sturge-Weber syndrome;
          lissencephaly; cortical malformation/dysplasia; and myoclonic absence. The patients
          enrolled in the study had severe, intractable, childhood-onset treatment-resistant
          epilepsy and were on stable doses of ASMs for 4 weeks before starting Epidiolex as
          add-on therapy. The initial dose of Epidiolex was 2 to 10 mg/kg/day (taken as two
          divided doses) and gradually titrated until intolerance or to a maximum dose of 25
          mg/kg/day or 50 mg/kg/day, depending upon treatment site. Of those enrolled in
          the expanded access program, 892 patients were evaluated and included in the safety
          analysis set and 840 patients were included in the efficacy analysis set. Through 192
          weeks, the median percentage reduction in seizure frequency across visit windows
          ranged from 50% to 67% for convulsive seizures and 46% to 66% for total seizures.
          In a cohort of 132 patients (72 children, 60 adults) with treatment-resistant epilepsy,
          bi-weekly seizure frequency decreased from a mean of 144.4 at entry to 52.2 at 12
          weeks (P = 0.01) and remained stable thereafter.15 Of note, patients with a diagnosis
          of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome were initially excluded because of
          preferential enrollment into the randomized clinical trials; once these trials were
          closed for enrollment, patients with these syndromes were also enrolled. In a
          separate cohort of patients with CDKL5 deficiency disorder and Aicardi, Doose, and
          Dup15q syndromes (n = 46), the percent change in median convulsive seizure
          frequency decreased from baseline to Week 12 by 51.4% and by 59.1% at Week
          48.16 There was a significant difference between the percent changes in monthly
          convulsive seizure frequency during baseline and Week 12 (P = 0.00001), with no
          difference in seizure percent change between Weeks 12 and 48. Of the 55 patients
          in the safety group, 27% of patients withdrew by Week 144 due to adverse effects
          (n = 4), lack of efficacy (n = 9), withdrawn consent (n = 1), and lost to follow-up (n
          = 1).

          ## Guidelines/Recommendations


          ### Dravet Syndrome

          At this time, there are three drugs approved for the treatment of seizures associated
          with Dravet syndrome: Epidiolex, Diacomit® (stiripentol capsules, powder for oral
          suspension), and Fintepla® (fenfluramine oral solution).1,11,17 An expert panel
          considers valproic acid and clobazam to be the first-line treatment for Dravet
          syndrome.4 If seizure control is suboptimal, Diacomit and topiramate are second-
          line treatment. Ketogenic diet is moderately effective and can also be considered
          second-line. The Dravet Foundation states that Diacomit, Epidiolex, and Fintepla are
          considered first-line agents for the treatment of Dravet syndrome.2 If control is still
          inadequate, other therapies to consider are clonazepam, levetiracetam, and
          zonisamide.2,4 Sodium channel blockers (e.g., carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine,
          lamotrigine, and phenytoin) can worsen seizures in Dravet syndrome. Additionally,
          vigabatrin and tiagabine may increase the frequency of myoclonic seizures and should
          be avoided.


          ### Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome

          Currently, the FDA-approved drugs for this condition are Epidiolex, Fintepla,
          felbamate, Banzel® (rufinamide tablet, oral suspension), lamotrigine, topiramate, and
          clobazam.12 Despite the lack of level I or level II evidence, valproic acid remains a
          mainstay in treatment.8,9,13 If valproic acid does not provide adequate seizure
          control, which is almost always the case, lamotrigine should be added as the first
          adjunctive therapy.7 If the combination regimen of valproic acid and lamotrigine does
          not provide adequate control, then Banzel should be initiated and either valproic acid
          or lamotrigine should be discontinued. If seizure control is still not achieved, the
          next adjunctive therapies to consider are topiramate, clobazam, and felbamate.
          There is limited evidence for the use of levetiracetam, zonisamide, and Fycompa®
          (perampanel tablet, oral suspension). Where possible, no more than two ASMs should
          be used concomitantly; use of multiple ASMs raise the risk of side effects and/or
          drug-drug interactions.


          ### POLICY STATEMENT

          Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Epidiolex. All
          approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
          required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Epidiolex as well as the
          monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
          requires Epidiolex to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
          specializes in the condition being treated.

          · Epidiolex® (cannabidiol oral solution - Greenwich Biosciences)
          is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
          met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
