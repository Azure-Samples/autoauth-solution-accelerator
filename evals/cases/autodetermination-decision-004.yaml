          ## 1. Background:

          Dupixent® (dupilumab) is an interleukin-4 receptor alpha antagonist indicated for treatment of
          patients aged 6 months and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is
          not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not
          advisable. Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. Dupixent is also
          indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma aged
          6 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma,
          as an add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with inadequately controlled chronic
          rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients
          aged 1 year and older, weighing at least 15 kg, with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and for
          adult patients with prurigo nodularis (PN).

          Limitation of Use:

          Dupixent is not for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.

          ## 1. Background:

          Dupixent® (dupilumab) is an interleukin-4 receptor alpha antagonist indicated for treatment of
          patients aged 6 months and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is
          not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not
          advisable. Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. Dupixent is also
          indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma aged
          6 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma,
          as an add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with inadequately controlled chronic
          rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients
          aged 1 year and older, weighing at least 15 kg, with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and for
          adult patients with prurigo nodularis (PN).

          Limitation of Use:

          Dupixent is not for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.

          ## 1. Background:
          
          Dupixent® (dupilumab) is an interleukin-4 receptor alpha antagonist indicated for treatment of
          patients aged 6 months and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is
          not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not
          advisable. Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. Dupixent is also
          indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma aged
          6 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma,
          as an add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with inadequately controlled chronic
          rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients
          aged 1 year and older, weighing at least 15 kg, with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and for
          adult patients with prurigo nodularis (PN).
          
          Limitation of Use:
          
          Dupixent is not for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.

          ## 1. Background:

          Dupixent® (dupilumab) is an interleukin-4 receptor alpha antagonist indicated for treatment of
          patients aged 6 months and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is
          not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not
          advisable. Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. Dupixent is also
          indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma aged
          6 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma,
          as an add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with inadequately controlled chronic
          rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients
          aged 1 year and older, weighing at least 15 kg, with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and for
          adult patients with prurigo nodularis (PN).

          Limitation of Use:

          Dupixent is not for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.
