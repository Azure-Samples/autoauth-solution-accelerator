        Prior authorization policy for Adalimumab (Humira) for Crohn's Disease and associated anemia due to blood loss. Related terms: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic intestinal inflammation, biologic therapy, TNF inhibitor, anemia management. Dosage regimen: initial loading dose of 160 mg (four 40 mg injections on day 1), followed by 80 mg (two 40 mg injections after two weeks, then 40 mg every other week. Treatment duration of 6 months with a total of 16 injections. Rationale includes initiation of biologic therapy due to severe symptoms and anemia related to blood loss. Alternative terms: ulcerative colitis, autoimmune disease, anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, and biologic DMARDs (Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs)."
      ground_truth: "Content from https://storagepriorauth72frx66.blob.core.windows.net/pre-auth-policies/policies_ocr/001.pdf was approved because it explicitly addressed the use of Adalimumab (Humira) for Crohn's Disease, mentioning prior authorization criteria and guidelines for TNFi usage in cases of severe Crohn's symptoms. It also referenced the American College of Gastroenterology guidelines, which are pertinent to the user's query regarding biologic therapy initiation."

        Prior authorization policy for Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) supplementation for the common cold. Related terms: upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), viral rhinitis, immune support, dietary supplement, antioxidant therapy. Dosage details: 500 mg daily for 1 week. Rationale includes supporting immune system function to potentially reduce cold symptoms and duration.
      ground_truth: "Content from https://storagepriorauth72frx66.blob.core.windows.net/pre-auth-policies/policies_ocr/001.pdf was rejected because it did not reference Vitamin C, common cold, or any related terms such as upper respiratory tract infection or antioxidant therapy. Content from https://storagepriorauth72frx66.blob.core.windows.net/pre-auth-policies/policies_ocr/004.pdf was rejected because it focused on therapies unrelated to Vitamin C or the common cold, such as anti-interleukin and anti-IgE therapies.', 'Content from https://storagepriorauth72frx66.blob.core.windows.net/pre-auth-policies/policies_ocr/001.pdf was rejected because it primarily discussed adalimumab products and did not mention Vitamin C or any conditions related to the common cold."
