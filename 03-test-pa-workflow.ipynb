However, the patient's weight or body surface area (BSA) is not provided. According to the policy, dosing for patients under 45 kg should be based on BSA. Without this information, it is not possible to confirm that the prescribed dose aligns with the policy's dosing guidelines. Therefore, additional information is required to make a determination.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dupixent® (dupilumab) is an interleukin-4 receptor alpha antagonist indicated for treatment of patients aged 6 months and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. Dupixent is also indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma aged 6 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma, as an add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 1 year and older, weighing at least 15 kg, with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and for adult patients with prurigo nodularis (PN).\n",

      "The prior authorization request for Blinatumomab (Blincyto) for patient Lucas Little cannot be fully evaluated due to missing patient weight and body surface area (BSA) information. Blinatumomab dosing for patients under 45 kg is based on BSA, and without this information, it is not possible to confirm if the requested dose of 28 mcg/day adheres to the policy's dosing guidelines for pediatric patients. Therefore, additional information is needed to determine if the dosing complies with the policy criteria.\n",

      "The patient meets the key policy criteria for treatment with Blinatumomab, including the diagnosis of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in remission with minimal residual disease (MRD+), and the medication is prescribed by a qualified specialist. However, the absence of the patient's weight and BSA prevents verification that the requested dose does not exceed the maximum allowed for a patient of his age and size, as specified in the policy.\n",

      "Adalimumab products are tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) approved for the following uses:1\n",
      "\n",
      "· Ankylosing spondylitis, for reducing signs and symptoms in patients with active disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Crohn's disease, for treatment of moderately to severely active disease in patients ≥ 6 years of age.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Hidradenitis suppurativa, for the treatment of moderate to severe disease in patients ≥ 12 years of age.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), ± methotrexate for reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular disease in patients ≥ 2 years of age.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Plaque psoriasis, for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe chronic disease who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy and when other systemic therapies are medically less appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ± conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), for reducing the signs and symptoms of active arthritis, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Rheumatoid arthritis, ± methotrexate or other conventional synthetic DMARDS to reduce the signs and symptoms, induce major clinical response, inhibit the progression of structural damage, and improve physical function in adults with moderately to severely active disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Ulcerative colitis, for treatment of moderately to severely active disease in patients ≥ 5 years of age. However, efficacy has not been established in patients with ulcerative colitis who have lost response or were intolerant to another TNFi.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Uveitis, in patients ≥ 2 years of age with noninfectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "TNFis are featured prominently in guidelines for treatment of inflammatory conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      ". Ankylosing Spondylitis and Spondyloarthritis: Guidelines for ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondylitis are published by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/Spondylitis Association of America/Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (2019).3 TNFis are recommended as the initial biologic. In those who are secondary non-responders to a TNFi, a second TNFi is recommended over switching out of the class.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Crohn's Disease: The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) has guidelines for Crohn's disease (2018).4 TNFis are listed as an option for disease that is resistant to corticosteroids, severely active disease, perianal fistulizing disease, and maintenance of remission. In post-operative Crohn's disease, a TNFi should be started within 4 weeks of surgery to prevent recurrence. Guidelines from the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) [2021] include TNFis among the therapies for moderate to severe Crohn's disease, for induction and maintenance of remission.17\n",
      "\n",
      "• Hidradenitis Suppurativa: British guidelines (2018) recommend consideration of adalimumab for those with moderate to severe disease who do not respond to conventional therapy.19\n",
      "\n",
      "· JIA: There are guidelines from ACR and the Arthritis Foundation for the treatment of JIA (2021) which address oligoarthritis and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis. For oligoarthritis, a biologic is recommended following a trial of a\n",
      "\n",
      "3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions - Adalimumab Products Prior Authorization Policy\n",
      "\n",
      "conventional synthetic DMARD.6 In patients with TMJ arthritis, scheduled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or intra-articular glucocorticoids are recommended first-line. A biologic is a therapeutic option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid escalation to a biologic ± conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following other therapies (e.g., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g., if there is involvement of high- risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage).\n",
      "\n",
      ". Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7\n",
      "\n",
      "· PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-naïve patients with PsA and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.8\n",
      "\n",
      "• Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2\n",
      "\n",
      ". Ulcerative Colitis: Guidelines from the ACG for ulcerative colitis (2019) note that the following agents can be used for induction of remission in moderately to severely active disease: budesonide extended-release tablets, oral or intravenous systemic corticosteroids, Entyvio® (vedolizumab intravenous infusion), Xeljanz®/XR (tofacitinib tablets/extended-release tablets), or TNFis.9 Guidelines from the AGA (2020) recommend Xeljanz only after failure of or intolerance to a TNFi. 10 In addition to the approved indication, clinical guidelines for the management of pouchitis (2009) indicate that first-line therapy for pouchitis is antibiotic therapy (e.g. metronidazole, ciprofloxacin).11 Other treatment options include maintenance probiotics, oral or topical budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., mesalamine), or immunosuppressive agents (e.g., infliximab).\n",
      "\n",
      "• Uveitis and Ocular Inflammatory Disorders: American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) guidelines (2014) note that adalimumab may be used in patients with uveitis due to various causes (e.g., spondyloarthropathy-associated or human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-B27-associated uveitis, JIA-associated uveitis, and other posterior uveitides and panuveitis syndromes). 12 Adalimumab should be considered second-line in vision-threatening JIA-associated uveitis when methotrexate has failed or is not tolerated (strong recommendation) and may be used as corticosteroid-sparing treatment for vision-threatening chronic uveitis from seronegative spondyloarthropathy (strong recommendation). Adalimumab may also be considered in other patients who have vision-threatening or corticosteroid- dependent disease who have failed first-line therapies. Adalimumab should be considered as a second-line immunomodulatory agent for severe ocular inflammatory conditions including chronic and severe scleritis. ACR/Arthritis Federation guidelines (2019) for uveitis associated with JIA make recommendations for use of conventional systemic DMARDs and biologics. In patients with severe active chronic anterior uveitis associated with sight-threatening complications, a TNFi (monoclonal antibody) + methotrexate is recommended.19\n",

      "## Other Uses with Supportive Evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "There are guidelines and/or published data supporting the use of adalimumab products in the following conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      ". Behcet's Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g., corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of Behcet's disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet's disease. 12\n",
      "\n",
      "• Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum. Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication. 14 Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e., infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15\n",

      "\n",
      "Dupixent® (dupilumab) is an interleukin-4 receptor alpha antagonist indicated for treatment of patients aged 6 months and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. Dupixent is also indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma aged 6 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma, as an add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 1 year and older, weighing at least 15 kg, with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and for adult patients with prurigo nodularis (PN).\n",

      "\n",
      "Dupixent® (dupilumab) is an interleukin-4 receptor alpha antagonist indicated for treatment of patients aged 6 months and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. Dupixent is also indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma aged 6 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma, as an add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 1 year and older, weighing at least 15 kg, with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and for adult patients with prurigo nodularis (PN).\n",

      "Dupixent® (dupilumab) is an interleukin-4 receptor alpha antagonist indicated for treatment of patients aged 6 months and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. Dupixent is also indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma aged 6 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma, as an add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 1 year and older, weighing at least 15 kg, with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and for adult patients with prurigo nodularis (PN).\n",

      "Dupixent® (dupilumab) is an interleukin-4 receptor alpha antagonist indicated for treatment of patients aged 6 months and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. Dupixent is also indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma aged 6 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma, as an add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 1 year and older, weighing at least 15 kg, with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and for adult patients with prurigo nodularis (PN).\n",
